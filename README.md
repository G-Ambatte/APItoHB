# D&D 5E API to Homebrewery Converter

This project aims to provide a simple interface for fetching data from [**D&D 5e API**](https://www.dnd5eapi.co) via their API and covert it to Homebrewery's V3 custom Markdown syntax.

## Instructions

1. Use the dropdowns and text entry field to complete the URL - to get the data from `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/2014/monsters/adult-black-dragon/`, you would select `2014`, `monsters`, and enter `adult-black-dragon`.

2. Press the **Fetch** button.

3. On the *Homebrewery* tab, press the **COPY** button.

4. Navigate to Homebrewery's new page - https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/new

5. Paste the content to your brew!
